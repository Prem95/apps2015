# iOS Applications
These are the iOS application I made using Swift 2 over the 2015 summer. 

# Why I made these?
I always wanted to know how does it feel like having your own mobile applications in the App Store, and that is what I did. 
Took me 4 months to learn Swift and develop these apps. 


*These are ONLY the raw code from .xcodeproj. You can always import the libraries I used and use different sprites by inspecting the raw code.
